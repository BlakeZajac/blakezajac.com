# Blake Zajac

Personal website built with Next.js and Sanity CMS. Designed and developed by Blake Zajac.

Sanity CMS probably won't be done for a while, or never, who knows.

## Requirements

-   Node.js v18.17.0 or later
-   Webpack CLI

### Installation

```
npm install
```

### Running the website

```
npm run dev
```

### Compiling assets

```
npx webpack --watch
```

### More general @todos

-   Move components folder into src. Probs use Gulp instead of webpack for compiling assets
-   Block and layout specific styles to be added in their respective component folder, and not in the sass boilerplate. The same goes for js
-   Migrate email delivery to React Email, set up key templates for marketing
-   Add an email capture block
-   Reminder to self that the @ syntax is available for importing. Review ya code.
